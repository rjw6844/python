# python
This is the start of my first python project.
I am learning python to do data science and learn how to use data for useful and meaningful purposes.  Recently I heard a story on NPR regarding the use of Data Science to design a program to predict violence against children.  This allows local communities to wisely allocate resources to prevent violence against children.  This caught my attention.
